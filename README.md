# Weekend jQuery Server Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 2 day Sprint_

This server-side calculator allows users to enter a math problem and returns a solution. The computation is done on the server-side and returned to the user to be displayed.  

One of the many challenges I faced while building this app was figuring out how to allow users to input numbers and a math operator in the text field only using the buttons. To access the value for each button, I assigned either a data-op or a data-number attribute to their corresponding button. Then their value are push into an array and added to the text input value attribute.
